# User Management Application

This is a **User Management System** designed for secure and efficient handling of user data, including authentication, role-based access, and state management. Built with **ReactJS** and **.NET 8**, this application provides a streamlined, scalable solution for managing users in any web application.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implements secure registration and login with JWT-based authentication for enhanced security.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Restricts access to specific routes and features based on user roles.
- **State Management**: Uses Redux Toolkit for centralized, efficient state management across the React application.
- **Form Validation**: Utilizes Formik and Yup to provide robust form validation and user-friendly error handling.
- **RESTful API Architecture**: Establishes a clear and consistent API structure, facilitating easy communication between frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **ReactJS** for building user interfaces
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Router DOM** for navigation and protected routes
- **Formik & Yup** for form handling and validation
- **Axios** for API requests

### Backend
- **.NET 8** for building scalable backend services
- **Entity Framework Core** for managing database interactions
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure token-based user authentication.

## Project Structure

### Frontend
- **Components**: Reusable UI components for consistent design and functionality across the app.
- **Pages**: Core application views such as Login, Register, and Dashboard.
- **Redux**: State management setup, including slices like `authSlice` for authentication.
- **Routes**: Organized as public and protected routes based on user permissions.

### Backend
- **Controllers**: Define API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.
- **Models**: Represent database entities and data transfer objects.
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic and data processing.
- **Middleware**: Manages JWT authentication and authorization.

## Standards and Best Practices

This project follows industry best practices for code structure, security, and maintainability, including:
- **Modular Code Structure**: Each feature is encapsulated in its own module, promoting reusability and scalability.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Variables, functions, and components follow standardized naming for improved readability.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures robustness in user interactions and API requests.
- **Clean Code Principles**: Adheres to clean code principles for readability, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Coding Standards**: Both frontend and backend adhere to consistent linting rules, type-checking (in TypeScript for React), and format enforcement.
